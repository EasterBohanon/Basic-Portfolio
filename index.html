                <p>Hello! ¡Hola! Oi!</p>
                <p>My government name is Easter Bohanon, but please feel free to call me East. 
                    I was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico and moved to Arizona at the tender age of six. I recently graduated from the University of Arizona with degrees in Marketing and Spanish and Portuguese.
                    I've always wanted to be a lawyer, except for a short 2 year period where I wanted to be an anesthesiologist, and dreamed of being a huge entertainment lawyer.
                    With the growth of technology, a low LSAT score and an article about the growing use of AI technology in law; I decided to change and explore technology. 
                    Which is why I am enrolled in this course.</p>
              <p>During my free time I enjoy dancing, I was a part of a few dance crews in college. If you ever feel like having a dance-off let me know.
                  I am looking forward to what I will learn and create, and hopefully so will you!</p>
